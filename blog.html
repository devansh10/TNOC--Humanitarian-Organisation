                  Rise Against Hunger is committed to promoting educational access through school feeding initiatives. These programmes have shown that by lowering short-term hunger, enhancing concentration, and raising attendance, they can enhance literacy results. The benefit of sending a kid to school in low-income nations, particularly those experiencing severe food insecurity, is not always obvious, especially when immediate necessities, such as putting food on the table for supper, take precedence. What purpose does the future serve if it does not ease the present? Parents, on the other hand, are strongly encouraged to take their children to school since they will get a hot supper. Over 300 schools are expected to have benefited from Rise Against Hungerworld in 2021 by providing nutritious volunteer-packaged meals or by purchasing food locally through local and regional procurement.

              </p>
              <p>

                  The School Feeding Initiative was launched in five countries in 2017 by Rise Against Hunger in collaboration with the Adventist Development and Relief Agency. India is included. One of our Empowering Communities sustainable agricultural initiatives, Planting Seeds for Strong Communities, is a continuation and development of that first project in rural Bihar. The schools we sponsor are moving to a home-grown school feeding model, which means they will be self-sufficient by growing their own food on-site and collaborating with smallholder farmers in the area.

                  Taurai currently serves as the head of a "top school" in India, where he hopes that "the school will be able to cover school fees for less affluent youngsters in our neighbourhood, so that they may attend school." The school has been able to create a suitable learning environment thanks to [the Rise Against Hunger] project's assistance."

                  One of the most cost-effective drivers of development and prosperity is investing in nutrition. Nutritional investments may yield a return of $16 for every $1 invested. In Africa and Asia, reducing malnutrition might boost a country's total economic output by 11%, as measured by GDP per capita.
              </p>
              <p>

                  Global development goals place a premium on nutrition. The Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs) of the United Nations are a collection of 17 global goals with precise targets for the world to fulfil by 2030 in order to eradicate poverty, safeguard the environment, and secure prosperity for everyone. "End hunger, achieve food security and enhanced nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture," according to SDG 2.

                </p>
                <p>
                        The work of The Power of Nutrition directly contributes to SDG 2 development, but it also benefits all SDGs indirectly. We also strive toward the global nutrition objectives set by the World Health Assembly for 2025, which seek to address the combined burden of under- and over-nutrition by achieving:The number of stunted children under the age of five has decreased by 40%.Anemia in women of reproductive age is reduced by 50%, and low birth weight is reduced by 30%.There has been no growth in childhood obesity.Exclusive breastfeeding rates in the first six months of life increased by at least 50%.Getting childhood wasting down to less than 5%

                 An estimated 189 million people in India were already undernourished before the pandemic began. According to a study released earlier this month, the first wave of COVID-19 pushed 23 crore more Indians below the poverty line, among them 90 million children who have been deprived of midday meals – the one assured meal per day – ever since schools have been shut.
                 So, despite the devastation being caused by corona’s second wave, for a large part of the population – which includes daily wage workers, agricultural labourers, construction workers, street vendors, small hawkers, etc – hunger is a more real, potent threat than the virus.

Millions across India are unable to make ends meet. A recent COVID-19 Livelihoods Survey by the Azim Premji University showed that hundreds of thousands of families have been compelled to reduce their food consumption during the pandemic.

At 25+ million, India now has the second highest number of total coronavirus cases after the United States. The pandemic has severely disrupted food security and nutrition, likely reversing the progress made towards the goal of ending hunger by 2030. With livelihoods lost because of the contagion and no income, lakhs of families belonging to the economically weaker sections have been pushed into poverty and are facing starvation and malnutrition. As Covid-19 rages on, thousands are losing their family members, and more families are losing their incomes, leaving them unable to cope.
